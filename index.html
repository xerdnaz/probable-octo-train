  <h2>Kayangan Lake, Coron, Palawan</h2>
  <p>
    Kayangan Lake is by far the most popular spot on Coron Island and for good reason. You cruise into the ‘parking lot’, which in itself is an immaculate reef with crystal clear water. After parking the boat you take a short hike up the stairs to the viewpoint before clambering down the other side to reach the famous Kayangan Lake. It’s a crystal clear freshwater lake with unbelievable underwater rock formations, which make it one of the most incredible sites in Coron, Palawan.

    Nacpan Beach is a four-kilometer strip of cream-colored sand and coconut trees with crystal clear turquoise water. It is located 17th kilometers north of El Nido town proper in Palawan.

    Rizal Park is one of the most significant landmarks in the Philippines.  Also known as Luneta Park and originally referred to as Bagumbayan during the Spanish era, Rizal Park is where the country’s national hero Jose Rizal got executed in 1896.
