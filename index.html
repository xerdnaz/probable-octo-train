  <h2>Boracay Beach</h2>
  <p>
    Boracay Island in the Philippines has been called the Ibiza of Asia, a honeymooner’s dream and a backpacker’s secret, but as the number of visitors increased, so too did the environmental issues. In an attempt to save the island’s ecosystem from ruin, in 2018 the island was closed for six months. Culture Trip speaks to locals about the effect the shutdown had.

  <h2>El Nido Palawan</h2>
  <p>
    You’ve probably seen photographs of the stunning limestone formations around El Nido rising majestically above the turquoise water. It is one of the most popular destinations in the Philippines and for good reason, the nearby islands and beaches are absolutely stunning. But the actual town of El Nido leaves something to be desired. The infrastructure has not yet caught up with the massive influx of tourists. Which means a lot of construction, contaminated water, questionable toilets, and high prices.

  <h2>Chocolate Hills</h2>
  <p>
    According to legends, the Chocolate Hills existed because of a weeping giant who had been disappointed in love, and the hills grew where his tears fell. In another legend, two giants went to war and lobbed boulders at each other for days. The giants eventually resolved their differences, but the mounds remained where the rocks landed.

  <h2>Undergroud River</h2>
  <p>
    It’s not surprising at all when Palawan has been recognized as the best island in the world by international travel magazines. With its pristine beaches and breathtaking lagoons, you will never be disappointed at what’s waiting for you. One charming treasure of Palawan that truly stands out is the Puerto Princesa Subterranean River National Park.
